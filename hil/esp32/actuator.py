"""VARUNA actuator interface, running on the ESP32.

Speaks the same framed, CRC checked protocol as the rest of the bench, so the
pulse widths this generates are the ones the flight computer's allocation
actually produced, carried over the same wire format rather than a second,
friendlier one written for the demo.

Eight LEDC channels at the standard 50 Hz ESC frame. On each command the duty
registers are read back and converted to microseconds, so the echo reports what
the hardware is really emitting rather than what it was told to emit. That
distinction is the point of putting a real part in the loop.

Console handling, which took two attempts to get right on this chip:

  * ``os.dupterm(None, 1)`` is wrong here. On ESP32 the console slot is 0, and
    index 1 raises ValueError.
  * Re-opening ``machine.UART(0)`` is also wrong: the console driver already
    owns UART0 and a second open fails with ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE.

Neither is necessary. While this loop is running the REPL is not parsing input,
so the running program already owns stdin. The only thing in the way is that a
0x03 byte inside a binary frame would raise KeyboardInterrupt, which
``micropython.kbd_intr(-1)`` disables for the duration.
